PROJECT: WORLD LITERACY VS HAPPINESS SCORE

PROJECT OVERVIEW:

The project aims to create an end-to-end data pipeline that extracts, transforms, and loads (ETL) data from CSV files stored in AWS S3. The data sources include countries’ literacy rates and happiness index, which will be joined in Snowflake for deeper analysis. Python scripts will handle data processing tasks, Astronomer with Airflow will orchestrate the pipeline, and Snowflake will serve as the destination for integrated data storage and analysis.

Results:

By joining countries’ literacy rates and happiness index data, it facilitates deeper understanding and exploration of potential correlations between education levels and happiness across different countries.
